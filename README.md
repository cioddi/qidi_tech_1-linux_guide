# qidi_tech_1-linux_guide

Information on how to use the "qidi tech 1" (and probably similar printers like "flashforge creator pro") in linux. Software options, Slicer config and best practices in general.

I only got my printer a few days ago so there is a lot of work to be done here.
I am using linux where ever I can and was a bit disapointed with the info that came with the printer and was given by the community. 

- The printer only ships with Windows and Mac OS software. And aso only info on how to use it with these operating systems.
- When searching google for slicer options you will get all the answers (including all the wrong options). When looking in the forums for e.g. cura machine settings you will find responses like "You can also grab the start and end GCode settings from the QIDI software under "Settings" and go to the "Start/End Gcode" tab. That's what I did to use Cura." which is not very helpful as I don't want to install windows and also the printer ships with two different slicer software options, so which one.

So for now this is intended to give linux users a smooth start into 3D printing with the "qidi tech 1" and similar printer models. Please feel free to create pull request it would be nice to have a canonical repository packed with useful information here (like cura machine settings) so linux users don't have to waste time to get things setup that work out of the box on Windows and Mac OS machines. That way we can focus on more important issues (as there are so many in 3D printing).
